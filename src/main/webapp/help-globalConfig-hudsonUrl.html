	<p>Optionally specify the URL for your Jenkins installation, e.g. http://yourhost.yourdomain/jenkins/. 
	This value will be used to generate links back to Jenkins from Campfire and should end with a forward slash.</p>
	<p>This is necessary because Jenkins cannot reliably detect such a URL from within itself.</p>
